# Simulation_Health

Process-oriented simulation of a health clinic with python

The purpose of this project is to develop a simulation of a health provider such as a clinic.

The objective of the simulation is to allow the investigation of different scenarios and possible resource allocations.
Initially the number of simulation runs required to provide reliable estimates of the population means is investigated.
Then the value of the clinic closing time for new patients is explored to prevent patients arriving but not completing treatment 
before the clinic closesy.
